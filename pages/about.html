                    Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of
                    websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring,
                    including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine
                    optimization.

                    Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although
                    some designers will cover them all.[1] The term web design is normally used to describe the design
                    process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web
                    design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development.
